**Car Price Predictor (Full-Stack)**:

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning deployment pipeline. It utilizes Python and Flask to handle API requests for the Linear Regression model, which is accessed via a responsive front-end designed with Bootstrap, styled with CSS, and enhanced with interactive elements using JavaScript.

**Key Features**

•	Comprehensive Car Dataset: Contains data on car name/model, manufacturer, year, price, kilometers driven, and fuel type.

•	Feature Engineering: Performed cleaning, extracted brand/model, converted year and kms to numeric, and handled missing or inconsistent values.

•	Machine Learning Pipeline: Incorporated one-hot encoding, regression modeling, and a streamlined workflow for price prediction.

•	Interactive Analysis:Explored key patterns in price based on brand, age, mileage, and fuel type through visualizations.

**Insights**

•	Brand & Model Impact: Certain brands and models demonstrate higher price retention over time.

•	Usage Patterns: Mileage and year strongly influence resale value, as shown in the analysis.

•	Predictive Accuracy: Achieved high r² score (0.84), validating the effectiveness of engineered features.

•	Data Challenges: Addressed issues with missing prices and removed major outlier records for model reliability.
